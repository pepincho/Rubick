# Ruby-Course-Project

## Idea:

## Languages & tools:
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

- [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) - A domain-specific language for building websites, web services, and web applications in Ruby. It emphasizes a minimalistic approach to development, offering only what is essential to handle HTTP requests and deliver responses to clients.
